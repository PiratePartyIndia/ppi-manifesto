As the pirate party we should take our stand on issues regarding demonetization. 
We should not complain about the past and whatever issues have already happened. Whatever the intentions, we must make do with the cards we are dealt.
Like many, i felt in the early days that the government did a wonderful job with the idea. But i dont think anybody can justify it now as any degree of sucess.

I propose the following as as the Pirate Party's stance on demonetization. We should be advocating for a law to be passed with these demands. This is an important distinction as the major issues that we are facing due to demonetization is basically due to the lack of a legal framework to deal with these issues.

1. 0 transaction Fees for all consumer-to-consumer and consumer to buisness transactions below a certain amount.

This measure has been implemented by some private entities like Paytm and some banks currently. But if as the government so kindly tells us that we are heading for a cashless India, It is imperative that it be written as an RBI directive or enacted by the legislature to enforce all banks to waive transaction / surcharges and all fees for low amount transactions to make it usable as cash for the common man.
It is imperative that we don't fall into the trap of complacency as while entities like paytm can offer a 0 percent transaction charge currently, there is really nothing stopping them but grabbing a huge market share of the transaction space and then upping transaction fees when consumers don't have any alternatives or choices in the matter. 

2. Fine for hospitals who are found denying medical treatment or withholding treatment to patients with old currency. 

All Hospitals and Medical Clinics and Pharmacies should be instructed that they cannot deny treatment to any individual if he cannot pay because of the cash scarcity that has been created by demonetization. The Hospitals should accept cheques/DDs or promise of such for any treatment by any patient and any time. This should be codified into law so that the hospitals can face legal charges and fines for any negligence of their patients. 


3. Bring the following entities under the RTI act so as to allow for better public transparency into private entities especially with regard to their financial disclosures.

> All Political Parties
We can easily tell now, that while the government rhetoric was once the capture of black money and stopping corruption, they have flipflopped quite dramatically on the matter.
We must demand that the RTI act be expanded to encompass political parties as there must be accountability of those in positions of power and influence as to how much they were aware of demonetization before it happened.

> Any Private Organizations providing Mobile Wallet services
It is as important to make sure that private for-profit organizations like paytm be watched carefully as they are now in a position to enable very privacy invasive programmes without any accountability and legal framework to do so. At the very least parts of their working policy should be covered under RTI so as to make sure that they are truly being effective.

> All Religious Organizations
It is common knowledge that since demonetization, you can go to any religious organization and exchange your old cash for new at a 30% rate. This is despicable and insulting to the millions of indians standing in line for a few thousand rupees every week. If a religious organization wants to keep its tax exempt status, they should open up their accounts as well as their members accounts to any RTI requests that they might receive. 


4. Start an initiative for free public wifi in marketplaces to allow for a low barrier of entry for cashless transactions.

If we are truly moving towards a cashless and digital India, the government should start an initiative for free public wifi. This while being a tall order to work out logistically, can be managed by offerring tax rebates to small buisnesses who open up their guest wifi for the public consumption. It is the easiest way to make sure that we have a decentralized system for public who might not have access to broadband internet to get some sort of access for the same.

5. Offer Subsidies for Startups engaged in the fintech sector.
The Government should add offer investment and provide encouragement and regulatory support for startups who are engaged in the fintech sector. Innovation is a very deep routed quality in Indians and we will always persever and find solutions to the problems that we face.
