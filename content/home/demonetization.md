+++

Demonetization is as a poorly thought out but well intentioned scheme by our dearest Central Government. The ramifications of demonetization will be felt well into the next few years and i have no doubt that out of the ashes of the current Indian Economy, a phoenix will rise. That is how Indians are wired. We grit our teeth and move on. 

We place no blame to the center for the fallout that is happening on a daily basisbecause of demonetization. They are doing the best that they can and we truly feel that the government should have our support.  

The Pirate Party of India doesn't believe in pointing fingers or casting blame. We seek only to move forward. To that end, we are proposing that we take a stand on the following issues. 

1. 0 transaction Fees for all consumer-to-consumer and consumer to buisness transactions below a certain amount.

If the government wishes to shove and kick it's citizens to a cashless India, It is imperative that it be policy as an RBI directive or an action by the legislature to enforce all banks to waive transaction charges / surcharges  and any and all fees for low amount transactions to make it more viable to be used on a daily basis.
While one can argue that private organizations such as PayTM are enacting such measures, It is imperative that we don't fall into the trap of complacency and not understand why they are truly acting this way. Private entities like paytm can offer a 0 percent transaction charge in the short term, simply to grab a huge market share of the fintech space. They as a for profit company have no obligation to anybody other than their shareholders. 
[If you are to belive the recent news about corporations behaving like a couple of passive aggressive 5 year olds](http://www.google.com/search?q=SBI+Paytm+twitter+disabled), then you would agree that clear rules and a firm hand are the best way to disciple children.
Failure to do so would result in catastrophic consequences for the future of our economy.

2. Fine for hospitals who are found denying medical treatment or withholding treatment to patients with old currency. 

We cannot allow ourselves to become a nation that doesn't take the safety of it's citizens safely. 
All Hospitals and Medical Clinics and Pharmacies should be directed that they cannot deny treatment to any individual if he cannot pay because of the cash scarcity that has been created by demonetization. 
[This is a Government of India Order expressing the same sentiments.](http://delhi.gov.in/wps/wcm/connect/103c91804efa5795842aa4d5b240798c/Fast+scan+to+a+color+PDF+file_1.PDF?MOD=AJPERES&lmod=93610279). The order however makes no note of any penalty or fine to the hospital in the event of the non compliance of this order. Hospitals should be held accountable for their actions.

3. Bring the following entities under the RTI act so as to allow for better public transparency into private entities especially with regard to their financial disclosures.

> All Political Parties
We can easily tell now, that while the government rhetoric was once the capture of black money and stopping corruption, they have flipflopped quite dramatically on the matter.
We must demand that the RTI act be expanded to encompass political parties as there must be accountability of those in positions of power and influence as to what their finances were before and after demonetization.

> Any Private Organizations providing Mobile Wallet services
It is as important to make sure that private for-profit organizations like paytm be watched carefully as they are now in a position to enable very privacy invasive programmes without any accountability and legal framework to stop them. At the very least parts of their working policy should be covered under RTI so as to make sure that they are truly being effective.

> All Religious Organizations
It is common knowledge that since demonetization, you can go to any religious organization and exchange your old cash for new at a 30% rate. This is despicable and insulting to the millions of indians standing in line for a few thousand rupees every week. If a religious organization wants to keep its tax exempt status, they should open up their accounts as well as their members accounts to any RTI requests that they might receive. 


4. Start an initiative for free public wifi in marketplaces to allow for a low barrier of entry for cashless transactions.

If we are truly moving towards a cashless and digital India, the government should start an initiative for free public wifi. This while being a tall order to work out logistically, can be managed by offerring tax rebates to small buisnesses who open up their guest wifi for the public consumption. It is the easiest way to make sure that we have a decentralized system for public who might not have access to broadband internet to get some sort of access for the same.

5. Offer Subsidies for Startups engaged in the fintech sector.
The Government should add offer investment and provide encouragement and regulatory support for startups who are engaged in the fintech sector. Innovation is a very deep routed quality in Indians and we will always persever and find solutions to the problems that we face.
