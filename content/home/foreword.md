I have great admiration for our current leaders and believe that they are doing the best they can for our coutry. The recent actions of the government are bold and present a much needed change to the existing status quo. But sometimes, one's best is simply not enough. The only criticism one can make is that the Government handled the transition badly. They did the best they could do, and we do applaud them for that. 
But good and responsible governance does not happen by one man. It is only when society rises together to change itself can we truly improve our way of life.

Governance is not just about decisions and policies made by the current party in power. 
Ask anybody you see walking in the street who his current MLA or MP is and you will understand the nature of the problem that faces our country. 

The average Indian feels powerless to affect change in society. The policies implemented by Government should be debated beforehand in a public manner. But would there be a point to it? How many of us do understand economic sciences? Politics is thus ruled by emotions. A politician rises when he is able to inspire confidence and trust in the masses. We trust our leaders to do the right thing.

We also need to challenge the threat of Privatization that is creeping upon us in India. we will soon find that all aspects of our lives are being controlled by private corporations who will put their profits above everything else. But how many of us can say what legislative action we support? Who do you call so that your voices may be heard in parliment?

The Global Pirate Party movement shares the ideals we need for our country. At the very heart of the movement is the right for every individual to share knowledge and take an equal part in society. 

This document is a draft. A work in progress if you will. It does reflect my thoughts and opinions. I will be placing this at github to guage interest in such a party and open up the document for debate.

If you believe as i do, in these fundamental issues. Then you might be a good fit to join our party!

* Educating the citizens of India - It is not a college degree that i care about. People should be informed of what is going on. Informed of their responsibilites and their duties. A Government is the responsibility of it's people, and only an informed electorate has any chance to affect change.

* Supporting the Movement of the Pirate Party of India. - As a grasroots movement, we need to find our niche, find our stand on global issues that face us. We need to spread the word. The PPI will *NOT* be accepting any financial donations until our status as a party is finalized. This is a conceptual experiment to spread the vision of the PPI and that is where we would need your help.

* Freedom of Information and Technology to solve Problems facing India - I believe like every open source enthusiast that information is meant to be shared. If we work together for the good of our country, we as a nation of programmers and techonological enthusuasts can definately provide solutions elegantly and also that can scale well.

* A strong Military - We need to spend more money to build indigenous factories and R&D centers to be more independant on our military. We stand at a critical position in world politics. We must invest in our military, we must convince more and moure youth to join as youth in the military. It is a core point of national crisis that nobody talks about. I was denied the oppurtunity to serve simply because of my physical stature. But the military needs programmers too, and we do need to mordenize ourselves.

* NRI's also have a duty to their country. - I have been an NRI for 20 years of my life, a resident for 6 years and an NRI again for the last 2. I have lived both sides of the argument. I think that NRI's should pay tax if it means that the country gives them a voice in chossing the government. If you ignore the NRI's then you cannot tax them, but if you give them rights and responsibilities, taxing them for the benfit of the country seems like the right balance in this scenario.

* Digital rights belong at the heart of politics. - We are in the Information Age and we should safeguard and protect the digital rights for our citizens. As the Pirate Party, we belive it should be the right of every Indian to have access to Broadband internet wherever he may be in our country. Some will say that how can you worry about internet when millions have no access to fresh water. I say solve both those problems at once, If you can provide a communal wifi station in a rural village, a communal water spot is trivial to add.

* Our Cultural liberties need strengthening and defending. - We cannot ignore the masses of our nation. We must not allow intolerance against any minority and in the same breath, we cannot allow any minority to proclaim itself more important than it's neighbour. We are all equal in the eyes of the law.

* Freedom of speech is vital for a thriving democracy. - Evey Indian needs a voice and the right to be heard. This is no more than our constitution grants us.

This manifesto is an experiment and a draft. A work in progress if you will. It does reflect my thoughts and opinions. I will be placing this at github to guage interest in such a party and open up the document for debate. 

As of now, I do require you to have github accounts to participate in any debate. I will add sections and write the manifesto little by little over the next month.

We seem to live in an age where politicians promise much, but all too often stand
for nothing. 

There can be no doubt what the Pirate Party stands for. We stand to break the feeling of powerlessness in politics, to truly give people their own voice.
